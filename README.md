# Hangman
Hangman: interactive python base version of the hangman game.

## Description
The Hangman project allows the a user to play a python version of the hangman game, in which a random unkown word is selected, the users selects the number of lives to guess the word and then tries to guess the word by entering a single letter once per turn. The game will end if the user runs out of lives or correctly guesses the word. This project aimed at solidifying my pyhton, command line, GitHub and conda skills from the AiCore course by applying them into a project.
